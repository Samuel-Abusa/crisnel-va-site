              <h4>The Benefits of Using a Virtual Assistant</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                Questioning whether virtual assistance sounds like a fit for
                your small business? Here are five of the biggest benefits of
                using their services.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>More Time to Do What You Love</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                Running a business can seem like an endless parade of pesky
                emails, phone calls, meetings, and appointments. These can
                quickly begin eating into your free time, leaving you with less
                time to handle the important stuff. Brittany Hardy, owner of
                Empty Desk Solutions elaborates:
              </p>
              <p>
                “Sometimes we know our plate is completely full, yet we cannot
                wrap our heads around managing an in-house team member. Virtual
                assistants are the perfect solution to many of the day to day
                business tasks that would otherwise require a part-time or
                full-time employee.”
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Rely on an Expert</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                As the virtual assistant industry grows, so too does the breadth
                of skills available to call upon. VA's often have years of
                experience under their belts in areas such as marketing,
                copywriting, social media, human resources, and even
                bookkeeping. Claire Costa, a Vancouver-based Virtual Assistant
                explains the benefits:
              </p>
              <p>
                “For small business owners, taking care of certain aspects of
                your business can mean making mistakes, simply because it's not
                your area of expertise. These mistakes can lead to so much extra
                work, so hiring a virtual assistant is as much an investment in
                your business, as it is your own free time.”
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Less Hassle</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                As your business grows, you'll likely need help. Unfortunately,
                you may not be ready to hire a full-time administrative
                employee. Establish how much you can afford to pay to get
                important admin tasks done, then find a virtual assistant to
                work within those boundaries. You don't have to worry about the
                tax implications, benefits, or get locked into long-term
                contract agreements.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Your virtual assistant will only charge for work done,” Claire
                explains. “You don't need to worry about tracking hours,
                covering source deductions, and all the other challenges a
                full-time member of staff brings. It's the perfect middle ground
                for a small business owner.”
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>A Personal Business Relationship</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                “People are literally putting their business in my hands, and
                that's a huge responsibility.” – Debbie Roche. It's natural at
                the beginning for a virtual assistant to concentrate on simple
                tasks like data entry, email management, or making travel
                arrangements, but as the relationship grows, you'll learn to
                rely on them more and more. With time and trust, you can ask
                your virtual assistant to take on more aspects of your
                professional life, becoming your own administrative rock start,
                and leaving you more time for…
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Strategic Thinking</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                Through the growing pains of a small business, you've probably
                become accustomed to taking a “do everything yourself” approach
                to management. If you're pulling 100-hour work weeks, it doesn't
                really leave much time for big-picture thoughts about direction
                and strategy. Delegating tasks to a virtual assistant means more
                headspace to devise new projects, big decisions or creative ways
                to grow your business.
