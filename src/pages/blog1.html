                So, you know you've got what it takes to be successful but
                aren't exactly sure where to start? That's okay. You want to
                make sure you get started the right way. This will help you gain
                your footing and ultimately grow a successful business. The last
                thing you want to do is get started without a plan in place.
                Grasping at straws hoping something will work isn't nearly as
                effective as going into the VA field with a well thought out
                strategy!
              </p>
              <br>
              <h5>Start Small</h5>
              <br>
              <p>
                I always recommend all beginners, no matter the profession, pick
                a niche. Whether you want to be a writer, proofreader,
                transcriptionist or, in this case, are wondering how to become a
                virtual assistant with no experience, the first thing you should
                do is settle on a niche.
                <br><br>
                Why?
                <br><br>
                It's much easier to find potential clients, land jobs, and
                establish yourself as an expert when you're focused on a
                particular group. And becoming an expert is what you should be
                aiming for. As an expert, you can command higher rates and will
                have clients seeking out your services rather than you
                constantly tracking down your next gig. If a virtual assistant
                niche isn't jumping right out you, here's some of the most
                common (and lucrative!) options you might want to consider.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Social Media Assistant</h3>
              <br>
              <p>
                Social media is a time suck for business owners, bloggers, and
                brands. As a virtual social media assistant, you can help free
                up a client's time by managing their social presence. This can
                include creating content, finding share-worthy articles, making
                pin-worthy graphics and responding to messages.
                <br>
              </p>
              <p>You may be a good fit for this niche if you:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Can pin, post, tweet, snap and update with the best of them
                </li>
                <li>Know what's trending before it's actually trending</li>
                <li>
                  Understand what it takes to generate buzz and create brand
                  awareness
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This particular VA niche has exploded in recent years and shows
                no signs of stopping. It seems like every day there's a new
                social platform to conquer and different best practices to
                follow. As a social media virtual assistant, you can be the pro
                that helps businesses, bloggers and brands attract new readers
                and grow a loyal audience
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Blogger's Virtual Assistant</h3>
              <br>
              <p>
                Bloggers are usually jacks and jills of all trades. That is,
                they do just about everything when it comes to creating,
                updating, and maintaining their blogs and online presence. When
                you're a one-man or one-woman show, it's hard to keep up with
                this daily routine. That's where you come in.
              </p>
              <p>As a blogger's assistant you may:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Help write, edit, and post blog content</li>
                <li>
                  Assist with graphics creation using applications like Canva or
                  PicMonkey
                </li>
                <li>Respond to reader emails</li>
                <li>
                  Optimize existing content by removing/fixing broken links,
                  adding affiliate links, etc.
                </li>
                <li>Help schedule social media</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you're just starting out as a blogger or have always wanted
                to start your own blog, being a blogger's VA is a great learning
                opportunity. You'll get a first-hand look at how a profitable
                blog operates and learn a tip or two along the way.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>E-commerce Assistant</h3>
              <br>
              <p>
                Running a virtual storefront requires a lot of upkeep. Online
                store owners may have hundreds of thousands of items in their
                ever-changing inventory. Plus, there are orders, returns, and
                general customer service inquiries to handle on a daily basis.
                How on Earth do they keep up? They outsource work to a virtual
                assistant, like you, of course!
              </p>
              <p>What you might do as an e-commerce VA:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Write product descriptions</li>
                <li>Respond to customer billing inquiries</li>
                <li>Track packages and handle returns</li>
                <li>Help promote sales and product launches</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Sellers may have their own sites or use a combination of popular
                platforms. Some of the most common ways to sell online include
                Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and Shopify. While you likely won't be
                handling physical merchandise as an e-commerce VA, you will help
                run the day-to-day operations of a store. This is a great
                opportunity to use your real-world retail skills in a virtual
                setting!
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Real Estate Assistant</h3>
              <br>
              <p>
                A lot goes into buying and selling a property. That's why buyers
                and sellers turn to realtors for help. Realtors secure home
                listings, help buyers find the perfect property, market
                listings, and stage open houses (to name a few). This is a lot
                to do for one person! To help stay organized and provide amazing
                support to buyers and sellers alike, realtors often outsource
                tasks so they can focus on their clients' needs.
              </p>
              <p>Some things you might do as a realtor's VA:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Schedule listing appointments and home viewings</li>
                <li>Market open houses</li>
                <li>Calendar management</li>
                <li>Write listing descriptions that sell</li>
                <li>Reach out to prospective buyers/sellers</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you have a background in real estate or simply have an
                interest in the field, this is a great opportunity to gain
                experience. While you won't actually be showing houses, you will
                play an important role in the realtor that helps contribute to
                their overall success!
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>General Admin Assistant</h3>
              <br>
              <p>
                I know I said it's important to pick a niche. So you might be
                wondering why the general admin assistant made the list. In
                reality, a general VA is a niche of its own. How so?
                Solopreneurs and small business owners need help. Chances are,
                they've got orders rolling in and clients to please. But there's
                also the internal things that need to get taken care of on a
                daily basis. It's hard to concentrate on delivering quality work
                when there's an administrative to-do list a mile long.
                <br>
                You can exclusively market yourself to these busy professionals.
                They don't have the need for their own receptionist or
                operations manager but they do need a helping hand to help them
                get more done in a day — and that person could be you!
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Where to Find Virtual Assistant Jobs</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                A number of companies contract with virtual assistants. These
                companies serve as the middleman between you, the VA, and the
                client. You'll likely work as an IC and be paid based on the
                number of clients you work with or amount of time you log. But
                if you're wondering how to become a virtual assistant with no
                experience, these companies might not be the best fit for you.
                Many of them exclusively contract with experienced VAs.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Time Etc.</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                However, if you come from an admin or clerical background, you
                might want to check out Time Etc. You don't need VA experience
                here to be considered but you will need to have previously
                worked as an executive assistant, receptionist, or any other
                admin-type position. This is a pretty flexible opportunity. In
                fact, if you have as little as three hours to spare each week,
                you can apply to become a VA here.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Fancy Hands</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                Another beginner-friendly platform to get your feet wet is Fancy
                Hands. This is a unique crowdsourced VA platform. Fancy Hands
                Virtual Assistants all have access to a pool of client tasks.
                Tasks are claimed on a first-come-first-served basis. So, you
                never know what kinds of jobs may be available at any given
                time. You're paid per task ($2.00-$7.00). Each one should only
                take about 15-20 minutes to complete. Payments are issued every
                two weeks via Dwolla.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Upwork</h4>
              <br>
              <p>
                Upwork is the largest freelance marketplace. There are literally
                thousands of gigs posted at any given time. It's free to sign up
                at Upwork. However, they take a 10% cut of any payments you
                receive! If you start out here, you'll want to fill out your
                profile completely and learn the art of crafting the perfect
                pitch. Ryan Robinson, a content marketing consultant to some
                big-name companies, knows a thing or two about writing a winning
                proposal. Check out his 5 Steps to Writing the Perfect Freelance

              <h4>Indeed</h4>

                you never know what VA positions you might come across here.
